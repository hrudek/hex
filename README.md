# Typr

Typr is a standalone iPhone dictation keyboard with a containing app, widgets and
Live Activity. Speech recognition runs on-device: Apple Speech (iOS 26+), Parakeet
V2 (iOS 18+) or Whisper Large V3 Turbo (explicit model download). An explicit
engine or language choice never silently falls back to another.

## How it works

- The app records and transcribes; the keyboard sends commands and inserts text
  through an App Group. The keyboard needs Full Access but never accesses the
  microphone, speech model or network.
- From a cold start, Dictate opens Typr to record, then returns to the host app.
  Host detection and return use private APIs with fallbacks. Transient surfaces
  such as share sheets require **Keep mic warm** instead.
- **Keep mic warm** keeps an audio session active so dictation can start without
  leaving the keyboard.
- Text processing combines vocabulary corrections, optional on-device Apple
  Intelligence cleanup (iOS 26+) and formatting styles. The full keyboard adds
  German/English autocorrect and adaptive suggestions.

## Build and test

Requires Xcode 26+ and XcodeGen 2.46.0+ on macOS:

```sh
cd ios
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild test -project Typr.xcodeproj -scheme Typr -destination "id=<SIM_UDID>"
```

Simulator tests exercise capture, handoff, text processing and keyboard logic.
Background microphone behavior, speech performance, host-app return, Live Activity,
Bluetooth/CarPlay and real typing quality require a physical iPhone.
