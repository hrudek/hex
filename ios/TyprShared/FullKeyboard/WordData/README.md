  English, also ä/ö/ü/ß for German), lengths 3–32; sum duplicate counts; compile
  into a forward-only, breadth-first trie. No invented spellings or capitalization.

## Reproduce offline

Explicitly download the two source files at the pinned revision outside the
repository. The compiler itself never accesses the network or app/runtime data;
its CLI rejects inputs with different SHA-256 hashes.

```sh
python3 ios/tools/keyboard_words/build.py de /path/to/de_50k.txt ios/TyprShared/FullKeyboard/WordData/keyboard-de.words
python3 ios/tools/keyboard_words/build.py en /path/to/en_50k.txt ios/TyprShared/FullKeyboard/WordData/keyboard-en.words
python3 -m unittest discover -s ios/tools/keyboard_words -v
```

The folder, including attribution and license, is bundled in both app and keyboard,
never the widgets. These counts are not a spelling dictionary; no accuracy claim
follows from inclusion.

## Corpus context sidecars (TBG1)

`keyboard-{de,en}.tbg` are **separate** corpus adaptations: Common Voice CC0,
named-owner Tatoeba CC BY 2.0 FR, Leipzig news (CC BY terms/version qualification),
Wikipedia (CC BY-SA), and OPUS OpenSubtitles (underlying rights unresolved).
They are not FrequencyWords or MIT data. R2-9 source-by-source terms, notices,
open questions and reproduction are in [SOURCE](../../../tools/keyboard_context/SOURCE). See
[ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md), [tatoeba-contributors.tsv](tatoeba-contributors.tsv)
and the linked full sentence source mapping. Preserve all three when redistributing.
The [explicit offline compiler](../../../tools/keyboard_context/README.md) pins
all input hashes and documents rebuilds; no acquisition or input files are bundled.

The packs contain no audio, raw sentences, neural weights, personal data or URLs.

`context-heldout-cc0.json` is a small **CC0 Common Voice** test fixture with source
revision/selection recorded inside. `swift-reference-vectors.json` is Typr-generated
numeric reference output for the fixed bilingual formulas. Both are inert test
resources, not runtime model inputs. Neither changes the sidecar training counts.
`context-heldout-r2.json` adds 64 globally test-partitioned sentences per language
and new source (384 sentences); it is **not CC0**. It is a test-only input, not
runtime prediction data; SOURCE and ATTRIBUTION apply to its excerpts too.
